# Admin Dashboard

The JD.AI Admin Dashboard is a Blazor WebAssembly application that provides a real-time management interface for the JD.AI Gateway. It connects to the Gateway via REST API and SignalR for live updates.

## Getting Started

1. Start the Gateway:

   ```bash
   cd src/JD.AI.Gateway
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:5189/`

The top-right corner shows a **LIVE** indicator when the dashboard is connected to the Gateway via SignalR.

## Overview

The Overview page provides a high-level summary of the Gateway state, including active agents, channels, sessions, and OpenClaw bridge status.

![Gateway Overview](../images/dashboard/dashboard-overview.png)

Key metrics displayed:

- **Agents** — number of currently running agent instances
- **Channels** — active communication channels (Discord, Signal, WebChat, etc.)
- **Sessions** — active chat sessions
- **OpenClaw** — bridge connection status

The **OpenClaw Bridge** section shows whether the bridge is enabled and which agents are registered.

**Recent Activity** displays real-time events as they occur.

## Web Chat

The Chat page provides a built-in web interface for communicating with agents directly from the dashboard.

![Web Chat](../images/dashboard/dashboard-chat.png)

Features:

- **Agent selector** — choose which agent to chat with from the dropdown
- **Streaming responses** — tokens stream in real-time via SignalR
- **Message history** — full conversation displayed with user/assistant bubbles
- **Clear conversation** — reset the chat at any time

Messages are sent to the Gateway's `AgentHub` and streamed back as chunked responses.

## Channels

The Channels page shows all configured communication channels and their connection status.

![Channels](../images/dashboard/dashboard-channels.png)

Each channel card displays:

- Channel name and type (web, discord, signal, etc.)
- Connection status (Online/Offline)
- **Disconnect** — stop the channel
- **Override** — configure channel-specific settings

The **Sync OpenClaw** button synchronizes channel configuration with the OpenClaw bridge.

## Agents

The Agents page lists all currently running agent instances with the ability to spawn new ones or stop existing agents.

![Agents](../images/dashboard/dashboard-agents.png)

The table shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique agent instance identifier |
| Provider | AI provider (ollama, claude-code, github-copilot) |
| Model | Model being used (e.g., qwen3.5:27b) |
| Turns | Number of conversation turns completed |
| Created | When the agent was spawned |

Click **+ Spawn Agent** to create a new agent instance. Use the trash icon to stop an agent.

## Model Providers

The Providers page shows all configured AI providers, their connection status, and available models.

![Providers](../images/dashboard/settings-providers.png)

Each provider card shows:

- Provider name and status (Online/Offline)
- Number of available models
- Model catalog with ID and display name

Supported providers include Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Ollama, and local GGUF models (via LLamaSharp).

## Settings

The Settings page provides a comprehensive WYSIWYG editor for all Gateway configuration. Changes are applied in real-time and persisted to the configuration file.

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard uses SignalR for real-time communication:

- **Agent Hub** — streams chat responses for the web chat interface

Connection status is shown in the top-right corner with a green "LIVE" indicator.

The dashboard is served as static files from the Gateway and communicates entirely through HTTP and WebSocket connections.
