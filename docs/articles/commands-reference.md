# Commands Reference

Slash commands are typed at the `>` prompt prefixed with `/`. Type `/help` to see all commands.

![Slash commands help output](../images/demo-commands-help.png)

## Model & Provider Management

### `/help`

Show all available commands with descriptions.

### `/models`

List all available models across all detected providers. Shows model ID, provider name, and current selection.

### `/model <id>`

Switch to a different model. The model ID can be partial — JD.AI fuzzy-matches.

```text
/model gpt-4o
/model claude-sonnet
/model llama3.2
```

### `/model search <query>`

Search remote model catalogs (Ollama, HuggingFace, Foundry Local) for models matching the query. Results include model ID, source, and download information.

```text
/model search llama 70b
/model search codestral
/model search phi-3
```

### `/model url <url>`

Pull a model directly from a URL. Supports Ollama model URLs, HuggingFace repository URLs, and direct GGUF download links.

```text
/model url https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2
/model url https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF
```

### `/providers`

List all detected AI providers with their connection status and available model count.

```text
Detecting providers...
  ✅ Claude Code: Authenticated — 1 model(s)
  ✅ GitHub Copilot: Authenticated — 3 model(s)
  ❌ Ollama: Not available
```

### `/provider`

Manage and inspect providers. Without arguments, shows an interactive picker to switch between available providers.

**Subcommands:**

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `/provider list` | Show all providers with status, model count, and auth method |
| `/provider add <name>` | Interactive wizard to configure an API-key provider |
| `/provider remove <name>` | Remove stored credentials for a provider |
| `/provider test [name]` | Test provider connectivity (all or specific) |

**Available provider names for `/provider add`:**

`openai`, `azure-openai`, `anthropic`, `google-gemini`, `mistral`, `bedrock`, `huggingface`, `openai-compat`

**Example:**

```text
/provider add openai       # Prompts for API key, stores securely
/provider add openai-compat # Prompts for alias, base URL, and API key
/provider test              # Tests all configured providers
/provider remove mistral    # Removes Mistral credentials
```

## Defaults Management

### `/default`

Show the current default provider and model (both global and per-project).

### `/default provider <name>`

Set the global default provider. This provider is used when no per-project or session override is active.

```text
/default provider openai
/default provider ollama
```

### `/default model <id>`

Set the global default model. This model is used when no per-project or session override is active.

```text
/default model gpt-4o
/default model claude-sonnet-4
```

### `/default project provider <name>`

Set the default provider for the current project. Overrides the global default when working in this project directory.

```text
/default project provider anthropic
```

### `/default project model <id>`

Set the default model for the current project. Overrides the global default when working in this project directory.

```text
/default project model llama3.2:latest
```

## Context Management

### `/clear`

Clear the entire conversation history. Starts fresh while keeping the same session.

### `/compact`

Force context compaction — summarizes the conversation to free up context window space. Use when conversations get long.

### `/cost`

Show token usage statistics for the current session: prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total cost.

## Safety Controls

### `/autorun`

Toggle auto-approve mode for tool execution. When enabled, tools run without confirmation prompts.

> [!WARNING]
> Use with caution — tools can modify files and run commands.

### `/permissions`

Toggle permission checks entirely. When disabled, all tools execute without any confirmation.

> [!WARNING]
> Equivalent to `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for the current session.

## Session Management

### `/sessions`

List recent sessions with ID, name, project path, and turn count. Sessions are stored in `~/.jdai/sessions.db`.

### `/resume [id]`

Resume a previous session. Without an ID, shows the list to choose from. With an ID, loads that specific session.

```text
/resume
/resume abc123
```

### `/name <name>`

Name the current session for easy recall.

```text
/name feature-authentication
```

### `/history`

Show the turn-by-turn history of the current session with role, token counts, and timestamps. Supports interactive rollback (double-ESC).

### `/export`

Export the current session to a JSON file. Saved to `~/.jdai/exports/`.

## Project & Environment

### `/update`

Check for new versions of JD.AI on NuGet and optionally apply the update.

### `/instructions`

Show all loaded project instructions (from `JDAI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.).

### `/plugins`

List all loaded plugins with their names, descriptions, and source paths.

### `/checkpoint`

Manage git checkpoints for safe rollback:

```text
/checkpoint list          # Show all checkpoints
/checkpoint restore <id>  # Restore to a checkpoint
/checkpoint clear         # Remove all checkpoints
```

### `/sandbox`

Show current sandbox/execution mode information.

### `/doctor`

Run all gateway health checks and display a human-readable diagnostic report.

```text
=== JD.AI Doctor ===
Version:  1.0.0
Runtime:  .NET 10.0.0
Health:   ✔ Healthy

Checks:
  ✔ Gateway       — Gateway operational
  ✔ Providers     — 2/3 providers reachable
  ⚠ Disk Space    — Low disk space: 0.4 GB free (minimum: 100 MB)
  ✔ Memory        — 142 MB managed heap
  ✔ Session Store — SQLite OK (14 sessions)
```

See [Observability](observability.md) for details on health check configuration.

### `/docs [topic]`

Show links to the JD.AI documentation site. Without a topic, lists all major documentation sections. With a topic, filters to the most relevant article.

```text
/docs
/docs observability
/docs health
/docs gateway
/docs config
```

Available topics: `observability`, `health`, `telemetry`, `gateway`, `config`, `providers`, `channels`, `commands`, `deployment`, `plugins`, `local`, `quickstart`.

## Local Model Management

### `/local list`

List all registered local GGUF models with their ID, display name, quantization, parameter size, and file size.

### `/local add <path>`

Register a model file or directory. If `path` is a directory, it is recursively scanned for `.gguf` files.

```text
/local add ~/models/mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf
/local add /path/to/models-folder/
```

### `/local scan [path]`

Scan a directory for `.gguf` files and merge discovered models into the registry. Without a path, scans the default model directory (`~/.jdai/models/`).

```text
/local scan
/local scan /opt/llm-models/
```

### `/local search <query>`

Query the HuggingFace Hub API for GGUF-tagged model repositories matching the search terms. Results include repository ID and download count.

```text
/local search llama 7b
/local search mistral instruct
```

> [!TIP]
> Set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for higher rate limits and access to gated repositories.

### `/local download <repo-id>`

Download a GGUF model from a HuggingFace repository. Prefers Q4_K_M quantization by default. Downloads support resume — if interrupted, re-run the command to continue.

```text
/local download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF
```

### `/local remove <model-id>`

Remove a model from the registry. The file on disk is not deleted.

See [Local Models](local-models.md) for the full guide.

## Customization

### `/spinner [style]`

Change the TUI loading/thinking spinner animation style. Without an argument, cycles through available styles. Available styles:

| Style | Description |
|---|---|
| `none` | No animation or progress display |
| `minimal` | Single dot with elapsed time only |
| `normal` | Braille spinner with elapsed time and token count (default) |
| `rich` | Spinner with progress bar, tokens, bytes, and throughput |
| `nerdy` | All statistics including model name, time-to-first-token, and internals |

```text
/spinner normal
/spinner nerdy
```

## Workflow Management

### `/workflow`

List all captured workflows. Workflows are recorded automatically during multi-step agent executions and can be replayed.

### `/workflow list`

Show the workflow catalog with IDs, descriptions, step counts, and when they were last run.

### `/workflow show <id>`

Display the steps of a specific workflow including tool calls, data flow, and dependencies.

### `/workflow export <id>`

Export a workflow to a reusable JSON file.

### `/workflow replay <id>`

Re-execute a previously captured workflow, optionally with modified parameters.

### `/workflow refine <id>`

Open a workflow for interactive editing — add, remove, or reorder steps before replaying.

### `/quit` or `/exit`

Exit JD.AI. Unsaved sessions are auto-saved.

## Gateway Channel Commands

The Gateway exposes commands natively on each connected channel. These work differently per platform:

- **Discord**: Registered as native slash commands (e.g., `/jdai-help`)
- **Signal**: Prefix commands (e.g., `!jdai-help`)
- **Slack**: Native slash commands (e.g., `/jdai-help`)

### `jdai-help`

Lists all available gateway commands and their usage.

### `jdai-usage`

Shows current usage statistics — uptime, active agents, total turns, and per-agent breakdown.

### `jdai-status`

Shows agent and channel health status — connected channels and running agents with uptime.

### `jdai-models`

Lists available providers, configured agent models, and currently running agents.

### `jdai-switch <model> [provider]`

Spawns a new agent with the specified model. Provider defaults to the current agent's provider if omitted.

```text
jdai-switch gpt-4
jdai-switch llama3.2:latest Ollama
```

### `jdai-clear [agent]`

Clears conversation history for an agent (first 8 chars of ID). Clears all agents if omitted.

### `jdai-agents`

Lists all running agents, their models, turn counts, uptime, and routing table mappings.
