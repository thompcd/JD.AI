# Sessions & History

JD.AI automatically saves conversation history to a local SQLite database so you can resume where you left off. Sessions capture turns, token usage, tool calls, and files touched — giving you a complete record of each interaction.

## How it works

- Sessions are stored in SQLite at `~/.jdai/sessions.db`
- Each session tracks turns, token usage, tool calls, and files touched
- Sessions are auto-saved when you exit

No external dependencies are required. The database is created on first run and managed transparently.

## Save and name sessions

```text
/name my-feature          # Name the current session
/save                     # Explicitly save current state
```

Naming a session makes it easy to find later. Descriptive names like `/name feature/rate-limiting` or `/name bugfix/auth-timeout` work much better than auto-generated IDs.

## List and resume sessions

```text
/sessions                 # List recent sessions with ID, name, path, turns
/resume                   # Interactive session picker
/resume abc123            # Resume specific session by ID
```

When you resume a session, JD.AI reloads the full conversation history. The AI model picks up where you left off with complete context.

## View history

```text
/history                  # Show turn-by-turn history with token counts
```

The history viewer shows each turn with its role (user, assistant, system), content preview, and token usage. Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> twice to open the interactive browser and select a turn to roll back to.

## Export sessions

```text
/export                   # Export to JSON at ~/.jdai/exports/
```

Exported JSON includes the full conversation history, tool calls, arguments, outputs, and metadata. Useful for archiving important sessions or sharing context with teammates.

## CLI session flags

Start JD.AI with session-related flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--resume <id>` | Resume a specific session on startup |
| `--continue` | Continue the most recent session |
| `--session-id <id>` | Attach to or create a session with a specific ID |
| `--new` | Start a fresh session (skip persistence) |

```bash
# Resume the last session
jdai --continue

# Resume a specific session
jdai --resume abc123

# Start fresh — no session history
jdai --new
```

## What's stored

Each session record includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Id** | Unique session identifier |
| **Name** | User-assigned name (via `/name`) |
| **ProjectPath** | Working directory when the session started |
| **CreatedAt** | Session creation timestamp |
| **UpdatedAt** | Last activity timestamp |
| **Turns** | Collection of conversation turns |

Each turn records the role, content, prompt tokens, completion tokens, tool calls, and files touched.

## Storage locations

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.jdai/sessions.db` | SQLite session database |
| `~/.jdai/exports/` | Exported session JSON files |

## Tips

- **Name sessions for easy recall** — `/name feature-auth` is easier to find than a timestamp.
- **Compact before saving long sessions** — use `/compact` to summarize and free context space.
- **Export important sessions** — JSON backups ensure you never lose critical history.
- **Per-project filtering** — sessions record the project path, so `/sessions` can filter by working directory.
- **Combine with checkpointing** — pair sessions with [checkpoints](checkpointing.md) for full project-state recovery.
