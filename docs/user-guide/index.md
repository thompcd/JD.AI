# Welcome to JD.AI

JD.AI is an AI-powered terminal assistant that brings intelligent code understanding, generation, and project management directly to your command line. Built on [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/), it connects to 14 AI providers — from cloud APIs to fully offline local models — and ships with a rich set of built-in developer tools.

This guide covers everything you need to use JD.AI day-to-day.

## Who is this for?

This guide is written for developers who want to use JD.AI as a daily productivity tool. Whether you're exploring an unfamiliar codebase, fixing a bug, writing tests, or creating pull requests, JD.AI can help you move faster.

No prior experience with AI assistants is required. If you can use a terminal, you can use JD.AI.

You can use JD.AI with cloud providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, with self-hosted models via Ollama, or completely offline with local GGUF models — the choice is yours.

## Quick start

Install JD.AI as a global .NET tool and launch it in your project:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global JD.AI
cd /path/to/your/project
jdai
```

JD.AI detects available providers, selects the best model, and drops you into an interactive session. Ask questions, request code changes, run commands — all from the `>` prompt.

For the full walkthrough, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md).

## Key capabilities

- **14 AI providers** — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Ollama, local GGUF models, and more
- **17 tool categories** — file I/O, search, shell, git, web, memory, subagents, and others
- **33+ slash commands** — model switching, session management, workflows, diagnostics
- **Session persistence** — save and resume conversations across terminal sessions
- **Project instructions** — configure per-project behavior with a `JDAI.md` file
- **Git checkpointing** — automatic snapshots before destructive operations

## How JD.AI works

When you type a message at the `>` prompt, JD.AI sends it to your configured AI provider along with conversation history and project context. The AI responds with text, tool calls, or both. Tool calls — like reading a file, running a test, or committing code — are executed locally on your machine after you confirm them.

This loop continues until the task is done. You stay in control: every file write, shell command, and git operation requires your approval unless you opt into auto-run mode.

## Getting help

- Type `/help` at the prompt to see all available commands.
- Run `/doctor` to check system health and provider connectivity.
- Run `/docs` to browse documentation links from within JD.AI.
- Check `/cost` to monitor token usage during a session.
- File issues at [github.com/JerrettDavis/JD.AI](https://github.com/JerrettDavis/JD.AI/issues).

## Next steps

Start with [Installation](installation.md) if you haven't set up JD.AI yet, or jump to [Quickstart](quickstart.md) if it's already installed.

For experienced users, the [Common Workflows](common-workflows.md) and [Best Practices](best-practices.md) pages are the fastest path to getting the most out of JD.AI.

Happy coding!
