# Local Models

JD.AI can run GGUF language models directly in-process via [LLamaSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/LLamaSharp), a C# binding for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). This enables fully standalone operation — no Ollama, no cloud API keys, no internet connection.

## Quick start

1. Download a GGUF model (example: TinyLlama for testing):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.jdai/models
curl -L -o ~/.jdai/models/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf \
  https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

2. Launch JD.AI — the model is auto-detected:

```text
Detecting providers...
  ✓ Local: 1 model(s) [Cpu]
```

3. Select it with `/model tinyllama` or through the `/models` picker.

## Model sources

JD.AI discovers models from four sources:

| Source | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Local file** | A single `.gguf` file path | `/local add ~/my-model.gguf` |
| **Directory scan** | Recursive scan for `.gguf` files | Automatic on startup in `~/.jdai/models/` |
| **HuggingFace Hub** | Search and download from HF | `/local search llama 7b` |
| **Remote URL** | Direct HTTP(S) download with resume | `/local download <repo-id>` |

## Managing local models

Use the `/local` slash command family to manage your model library.

### List registered models

```text
/local list
```

Shows all models in the registry with their ID, display name, quantization, and file size.

### Add a model file or directory

```text
/local add /path/to/model.gguf
/local add /path/to/models-folder/
```

Registers the file (or recursively scans the directory) and persists the registry.

### Scan for models

```text
/local scan
/local scan /path/to/custom/directory
```

Scans the specified directory (or the default model directory) for `.gguf` files and merges them into the registry.

### Search HuggingFace

```text
/local search llama 7b
/local search mistral instruct
```

Queries the HuggingFace Hub API for GGUF-tagged model repositories. Results include repo ID and download count.

> [!TIP]
> Set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate with HuggingFace for higher rate limits and access to gated models.

### Download from HuggingFace

```text
/local download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF
```

Downloads the best-quality GGUF file (prefers Q4_K_M) from the specified HuggingFace repository. Downloads support resume — if interrupted, re-running the command continues where it left off.

### Remove a model

```text
/local remove <model-id>
```

Removes the model from the registry. The file on disk is not deleted.

## Model registry

JD.AI tracks all known models in a JSON manifest at `~/.jdai/models/registry.json`. The registry stores model ID, display name, file path, size, quantization type, parameter size, source, and timestamp.

On startup, the registry is loaded, stale entries pointing to missing files are pruned, the model directory is scanned for new files, and the registry is saved.

## GPU acceleration

LLamaSharp auto-detects available GPU hardware at startup:

| Backend | Platforms | Detection |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **CUDA** | Windows, Linux | Checks for NVIDIA native libraries |
| **Metal** | macOS | Always available on Apple Silicon |
| **CPU** | All | Fallback — always available |

The detected backend is shown in the provider status line:

```text
✓ Local: 3 model(s) [Cuda]
```

By default, all model layers are offloaded to the GPU. If GPU loading fails (e.g., insufficient VRAM), JD.AI falls back to CPU automatically.

> [!TIP]
> Only one local model is loaded at a time. Switching models via `/model` unloads the previous model and frees memory before loading the new one.

## Choosing a model

GGUF models vary in size, quality, and hardware requirements:

| Category | Parameters | RAM required | Use case |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Tiny** | 1–3B | 1–3 GB | Testing, quick iteration, low-resource machines |
| **Small** | 7–8B | 5–8 GB | General coding assistance, good quality/speed balance |
| **Medium** | 13–14B | 10–16 GB | Higher quality, needs decent hardware |
| **Large** | 30–70B | 24–64 GB | Best quality, requires high-end GPU or large RAM |

**Recommended quantization:** Q4_K_M — good balance of quality and performance for most use cases.

| Quantization | Quality | Size vs. F16 |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Q2_K | Low | ~25% |
| Q4_K_M | Good (recommended) | ~40% |
| Q5_K_M | Very good | ~50% |
| Q6_K | Near-original | ~60% |
| Q8_0 | Excellent | ~75% |
| F16 | Original | 100% |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `JDAI_MODELS_DIR` | Model storage and registry directory | `~/.jdai/models/` |
| `HF_HOME` | HuggingFace cache directory | `~/.cache/huggingface/` |
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace API token for authenticated access | — |

## Troubleshooting

### No local models detected

Add a model:

```text
/local add /path/to/model.gguf
/local download TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF
```

### Model fails to load (out of memory)

Use a smaller model or lower quantization. Force CPU-only mode by setting GPU layers to 0.

### Slow inference

Install CUDA drivers for NVIDIA GPUs. Check startup status shows `[Cuda]` not `[Cpu]`. Use a smaller quantization like Q4_K_M.

### HuggingFace search returns no results

Set `HF_TOKEN` for authenticated access. Check network connectivity.
